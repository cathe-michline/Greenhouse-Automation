Greenhouse Automation using IOT 

The primary issue of greenhouse and terrace farming is to comply with the economic and environmental requirements such as pest control, crop disease, heat and humidity extremities and irrigation which have to be controlled as these play a major role for better yield and productivity.

	With the help of IoT-powered automated control and real-time monitoring of all crop conditions and processes, you can maximize the production and quality of your crops. Hence, without much ado, farmers must integrate easy-to-use automated controls and remote monitoring systems to run their commercial greenhouse in an efficient and hassle-free manner.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Our idea is to make an automated green house control System that ensures that we protect our plants by maintaining an optimal as well as consistent temperature in our greenhouse. This also helps to prevent the growth of disease-causing factors such as algae or mildew in your plants. 
The uniqueness of our application is that it supports the sustainable goal :  Affordable and Clean energy by suggesting organic fertilizers as a substituent for the chemical fertilizers by monitoring the soil nutrients.
