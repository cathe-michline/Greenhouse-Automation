# Greenhouse-Automation

## Overview
Greenhouse Automation using IoT

The primary issues in greenhouse and terrace farming include pest control, crop disease, heat and humidity extremes, and irrigation. These factors play a significant role in achieving better yield and productivity. 

With IoT-powered automated control and real-time monitoring of crop conditions and processes, you can maximize production and quality. Farmers should integrate easy-to-use automated controls and remote monitoring systems for efficient and hassle-free commercial greenhouse management.

## Proposed Solution
Our solution is an automated greenhouse control system that maintains an optimal and consistent temperature, helping to prevent the growth of disease-causing factors such as algae or mildew. The application supports the sustainable goal of Affordable and Clean Energy by suggesting organic fertilizers as a substitute for chemical fertilizers through soil nutrient monitoring.
